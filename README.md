# Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics XCFramework

A Swift package for pre-built Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics xcframeworks.

This is a fork of [akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks](https://github.com/akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks), which offers the full Firebase SDK. This repo has been modified to keep only Analytics and Crashlytics frameworks.
